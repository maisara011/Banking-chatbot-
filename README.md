## Project Description

**BankBot** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to intelligently answer **banking-related Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
The system enables users to interact in natural language and receive accurate, context-aware responses related to banking services such as accounts, loans, interest rates, cards, and general policies.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of **LLM-based conversational AI** and is suitable for **Infosys certification**, **academic evaluation**, and **real-world deployment** scenarios.

## Features

* 💬 Natural language conversation for banking FAQs
* 🧠 Context-aware AI responses
* 🔁 Configurable LLM backend (easy to switch models)
* ⚡ Fast response generation
* 🏦 Domain-specific prompt tuning for banking
* 🖥️ Easy local execution
* 📄 Clean and modular project structure

---

## Techniques Used

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* Text preprocessing and normalization
* User intent understanding
* Context preservation across queries

### Prompt Engineering

* Domain-specific prompt design for banking use cases
* Controlled and safe response generation
* Prompt templates for consistent outputs

### LLM-based Text Generation

* Transformer-based text generation
* Instruction-following conversational AI
* Scalable and model-agnostic design

---

## Tech Stack

### Programming Language

* **Python**

### Libraries / Frameworks

* `transformers`
* `torch`
* `nltk`
* `sentencepiece`
* `streamlit` / `flask` (for UI or API layer)
* `pandas`
* `numpy`

### AI / ML Technologies

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Large Language Models (LLMs)
* Transformer architecture
* Prompt Engineering

---

## LLM Details

* Uses **transformer-based Large Language Models**
* Supports models such as:

  * GPT-style models
  * Instruction-tuned transformer LLMs
* **LLM is fully configurable**:

  * Model name
  * Token length
  * Temperature
  * Inference parameters

This design allows easy replacement or upgrade of the LLM without changing core application logic.
